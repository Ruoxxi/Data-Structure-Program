These days, people can acquire the resources of education more and more convenient and easy, which owes to the fast development of technology. I don’t think this is a phenomenon that may do something harmful to society.
First of all, isn’t that those online lessons and numbers of application relative to education give us much more convenience while studying? There’s no doubt that we need these sources to improve ourselves, technology gives us the chance to make us better easier, we have no reason to refuse it. Whereas, just like everything has both its good and bad sides, today’s phenomenon has actually impacted the traditional education style, which some individuals are still can’t adapted to. Though, I hold the view that its advantages are much huger than disadvantages, because this is an inexorable trend of the development of education.
Secondly, the improvement is not unidirectional. While technology urging education’s growing, the technology itself is also pushed by this kind of educational style. What’s more, it’s not only beneficial for technology, but also do a favor for the growth of economic.
All in all, it’s undeniable that it is difficult to say whether is good or not in general. For my past, I don’t agree the discuss that this phenomenon is harmful at all.
